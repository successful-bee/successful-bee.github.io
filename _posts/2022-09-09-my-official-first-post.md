- I created a Github account in a previous personal study and started editing with instruction from Tech Expert Academy
1. I forked a repository from https://github.com
2. I renamed the forked repository successful-bee.github.io
3. I edited the files as described in the README.md
4. Now i am writing my first post by following the advice i got from the README file
